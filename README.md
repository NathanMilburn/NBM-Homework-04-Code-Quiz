MY USER STORY 

AS AN aspiring software engineer and coding boot camp student

I WANT to develop a quiz with a set timer using effective JavaScript fundamentals that provides users with quiz scores based on their performance that will be listed on a high score sheet

SO THAT I can showcase my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals while also challenging my peers to fun brain teasers

SUPPLIED USER STORY

AS A coding boot camp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

I began this process by updating my instructor-supplied placeholder questions with questions of my own, then added another four questions to increase the length and challenge of the quiz.

Next I created as many of the relevant css,html, and js pages as I thought were needed to link between each page when starting the game, answering questions, inputing username info for the leaderboards page, and leaderboards page.

After this, I decided to implement some css styling to keep the same general color pallete as my portfolio website to maintain a consistent them when visiting my main page.
